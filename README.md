# Singularity Builder
This is a [packer](https://www.packer.io/docs/command-line/build.html) configuration to generate build instances (images) on different cloud platforms. 


	packer build builder.json 
	googlecompute output will be in this color.

	==> googlecompute: Checking image does not exist...
	==> googlecompute: Creating temporary SSH key for instance...
	==> googlecompute: Creating instance...
	    googlecompute: Loading zone: us-west1-a

	    googlecompute: Disk has been deleted!
	Build 'googlecompute' finished.

	==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:
	--> googlecompute: A disk image was created: singularity-hub-test-58151473-5671-eed2-1511-c8afdb680a36

This script can be used outside of Singularity Hub/Singularity Python - currently we aren't using Packer to generate the image because there seems to be an issue with installing Singularity with it. Instead, the image is created interactively, and saved for Singularity Hub. If you get the packer version to work, please let us know!
